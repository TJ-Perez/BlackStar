# Black-Star WebGL Edition!

This is a project from DIS Copenhagen created by Dejie Zhen, Caroline Taft, Juliet DeNapoli, and TJ Perez. I've ported it to work in modern day (2025) Unity and run in WebGL! Feel free to download the repo and make changes if you would like.

NOTE:
I had to disable the scoreboard feature for WebGL compatibility. Maybe it could be added back to the WebGL version some day!
